PURPOSE
=======
The purpose of this mobile site is to create a way for semi-organized basketball tournaments/leagues/events can allow people to effectively track player and team stats. This idea came about as I was at a local basketball tournament and everyone was using a very basic google spreadsheet and the score keepers weren't able to track stats in an efficient manner (they had to rummage through the spreadsheet to find the stats). Also, they were using laptops that had poor wireless connections so updating was a challenge. If the stat trackers could have used their phone's (being as all of them did have smartphones) browser to access a site that could track teams and player stats, I believe tracking would've been much more reliable and accurate.
