### Basketball League Tracker Website

## Purpose:  
To create a website that allows users to track basketball game stats via a mobile site.  It will be twofold in that:
1. Score keepers can easily track stats of games that are currently going on.
2. Viewers can check previous games as well as games in real-time.

Requirements:
As platform agnostic as possible (I.E. works on Android, IOS, Windows Mobile, Linux, etc).
Quickly store and retrieve data ("feels" fast to the user).
Simple clean design that allows users to navigate quickly and easily on screens ranging from 3.5‚Äù to 10".
